## Exploration Objective
What question are we trying to answer or what area are we investigating?

## Context
**Why this exploration is needed**:
- Problem we're facing
- Decision we need to make
- Knowledge gap to fill
- Risk to assess

**Background**:
- Current state
- Related work
- Previous decisions
- Constraints

## Research Questions
Primary questions to answer:

1. **[Question 1]**
   - Why this matters
   - What we need to know

2. **[Question 2]**
   - Why this matters
   - What we need to know

3. **[Question 3]**
   - Why this matters
   - What we need to know

## Exploration Scope
**In scope**:
- Areas to investigate
- Code to analyze
- Technologies to evaluate
- Patterns to assess

**Out of scope**:
- What we're not exploring (yet)
- Future exploration topics

## Methodology
**Approach**:
1. Review existing documentation
2. Analyze code/architecture
3. Research best practices
4. Evaluate options
5. Prototype if needed
6. Document findings

**Tools/Resources**:
- Documentation sources
- Example codebases
- Community resources
- Expert consultations

## Evaluation Criteria
How we'll assess options/approaches:

- **Technical feasibility**: Can we build it with our stack?
- **Performance**: Will it meet performance requirements?
- **Maintainability**: Can we maintain it long-term?
- **Developer experience**: Is it easy to work with?
- **Cost**: Development time and ongoing costs
- **Risk**: What could go wrong?
- **Alignment**: Fits with architecture and PRD?

## Findings

### Architecture Insights (if architecture exploration)
**Current architecture**:
- Component relationships
- Data flow
- Dependencies

**Strengths**:
- What's working well

**Weaknesses**:
- What could be improved

**Scalability concerns**:
- Potential bottlenecks
- Growth limitations

## Recommendation
**Recommended approach**: [Option X]

**Rationale**:
- Why this option is best
- Trade-offs we're accepting
- Risks we're mitigating
