   - **Test 2: Design Tokens → Components**
     - Render all components in test screen
     - Verify colors/typography from tokens
     - Test component variants
     - Check accessibility

   - **Test 3: Database Integrity**
     - Run all verification scripts
     - Check RLS policies active
     - Verify seed data accessible
     - Test pgvector similarity search

   - Document all test results
