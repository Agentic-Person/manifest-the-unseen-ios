## Objective
Install all core dependencies for audio, forms, authentication, and obtain API keys for Claude, OpenAI, and RevenueCat.

## Context
**Why this task is important**:
- Core libraries must be installed before Week 2 feature development
- API keys are required for AI chat and voice transcription features
- RevenueCat configuration needed for subscription implementation

**Related documentation**:
- TDD Section 7: Audio Architecture
- TDD Section 8: AI Integration
- PRD Section 9: Monetization (RevenueCat)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Audio**: react-native-track-player and audio recorder installed
- [ ] **Forms**: React Hook Form and Zod installed
- [ ] **API Keys**: Claude, OpenAI, RevenueCat keys obtained
- [ ] **Environment**: All keys documented in `.env`
- [ ] **Testing**: Dependencies load without errors
- [ ] **Documentation**: Setup guide updated

## Implementation Steps

1. **Install Audio Libraries** (1h)
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm install react-native-track-player
   npm install react-native-audio-recorder-player
   npm install react-native-whisper  # On-device transcription
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```
   - Test audio player initialization
   - Test audio recorder initialization
   - Verify iOS permissions configured in Info.plist:
     ```xml
     <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need microphone access for voice journaling.</string>
     ```

2. **Install Form Libraries** (0.5h)
   ```bash
   npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
   ```
   - Create example Zod schema
   - Create example form component
   - Test validation

3. **Obtain API Keys** (1h)
   - **Anthropic Claude API**:
     - Go to console.anthropic.com
     - Create API key
     - Note key in secure password manager
   - **OpenAI API**:
     - Go to platform.openai.com
     - Create API key
     - Note key in secure password manager
   - **RevenueCat**:
     - Go to revenuecat.com
     - Create account
     - Create project
     - Note API key

4. **Configure Environment** (0.5h)
   - Update `.env.example`:
     ```
     # Supabase (from TASK-002)
     SUPABASE_URL=
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

     # AI APIs
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
     OPENAI_API_KEY=

     # Subscriptions
     REVENUECAT_API_KEY=
     ```
   - Install react-native-config: `npm install react-native-config`
   - Configure for iOS (Info.plist)
   - Test environment variables load

## Dependencies
**Blocks**: Week 2 feature development
**Blocked By**: TASK-003 (React Native setup)
**Related**: TASK-002 (Supabase keys already obtained)

## Agent Instructions
**Recommended agent**: Backend Specialist + Frontend Specialist (joint task)

Backend Specialist: Obtain and document API keys
Frontend Specialist: Install and configure libraries

Test all dependencies after installation. Verify iOS build still works after adding native modules.

## Progress Notes
**[2025-11-17] - Orchestrator**:
- Task created for Day 5 (Week 1)
- Priority: P1
- This task unblocks Week 2 development

## Final Notes
**IMPORTANT**: Never commit API keys to git. Always use .env files that are .gitignored.

After this task, Week 1 infrastructure is complete and Week 2 can begin.
