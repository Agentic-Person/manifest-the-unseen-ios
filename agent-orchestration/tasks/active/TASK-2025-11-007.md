## Objective
Complete Week 1 documentation, update master plan, and prepare Week 2 tasks for design system and database schema work.

## Context
**Why this task is important**:
- Ensures all Week 1 work is documented and traceable
- Updates master plan with actual progress
- Prepares clear tasks for Week 2 to hit the ground running
- Maintains orchestration workflow discipline

**Related documentation**:
- `orchestrator/master-plan.md` - 28-week roadmap
- `orchestrator/workflow-guide.md` - Weekly review process
- Week 1 session logs

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Session Logs**: All 5 daily session logs created and completed
- [ ] **Master Plan**: Week 1 marked as completed
- [ ] **Workstreams**: Authentication workstream updated with progress
- [ ] **Week 2 Tasks**: 5-7 tasks created for design system and database work
- [ ] **Retrospective**: Week 1 retrospective documented
- [ ] **Git**: All Week 1 work committed (if desired)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Complete Day 1-5 Session Logs** (0.5h)
   - Update `session-2025-11-17.md` (already created)
   - Create remaining: `session-2025-11-18.md` through `session-2025-11-21.md`
   - Document accomplishments, blockers, decisions for each day

2. **Update Master Plan** (0.5h)
   - Open `orchestrator/master-plan.md`
   - Mark Week 1 as "Completed"
   - Add actual completion notes
   - Update timeline if any slippage occurred

3. **Update Workstreams** (0.25h)
   - Update `workstreams/authentication/README.md` with readiness status
   - Note that infrastructure is ready for Week 3 auth implementation

4. **Week 1 Retrospective** (0.5h)
   - Create retrospective in session log or separate doc
   - **What went well**: Infrastructure setup, ADR process, task creation
   - **What could improve**: (To be determined after actual execution)
   - **Blockers resolved**: Tech stack conflict resolved via ADR-001

5. **Create Week 2 Tasks** (0.5h)
   - TASK-008: Define Design Tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
   - TASK-009: Build Component Library Primitives
   - TASK-010: Create Supabase Database Migrations
   - TASK-011: Set Up pgvector Extension
   - TASK-012: Define RLS Policies for All Tables
   - TASK-013: Seed Initial Data (meditation metadata, quotes)

6. **Git Commit (Optional)** (0.25h)
   - If user desires, commit all Week 1 work:
     - Session logs
     - Task files
     - ADR-001
     - PRD updates
     - Any code created (React Native project, Supabase schema)
   - Push to GitHub with message: "Week 1 complete: Infrastructure and setup"

## Dependencies
**Blocked By**: All Week 1 tasks (002-006) should be completed first

## Resources
- `orchestrator/workflow-guide.md` - Weekly review process
- `orchestrator/master-plan.md` - Timeline to update
- Task templates in `tasks/templates/`

## Agent Instructions
**Recommended agent**: Orchestrator (You)

This is your wrap-up task. Review all work from Week 1, ensure documentation is complete, and prepare for Week 2. This establishes the weekly rhythm for the entire 28-week project.

**Follow the workflow guide**:
- Morning planning routine establishes priorities
- Evening review captures progress
- Weekly retrospective drives continuous improvement

## Progress Notes
**[2025-11-17] - Orchestrator**:
- Task created for end of Week 1
- Priority: P2 (documentation and planning)
- This task ensures orchestration discipline

## Final Notes
**Week 1 Success Criteria** (from original plan):
- ✅ React Native project building on iOS simulator
- ✅ Supabase project created with users table + RLS
- ✅ Navigation & state management configured
- ✅ External API keys obtained and tested
- ✅ Core dependencies installed
- ✅ 5 session logs created
- ✅ ADR-001 documented
- ✅ 7 tasks created, 5-6 completed
- ✅ Development workflow established

After this task, Week 1 is officially complete. Week 2 begins Monday with design system work.

**IMPORTANT**: Week 2 will require MCP servers for design/UI work (as noted by user). Pause after Week 1 to set up MCP before continuing.
