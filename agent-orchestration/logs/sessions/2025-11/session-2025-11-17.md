## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: React Native + TypeScript (Final)
- **Context**: PRD specified Swift/SwiftUI, but TDD and CLAUDE.md specified React Native. All specialist agent prompts were built for React Native.
- **Options Considered**:
  1. Native Swift/SwiftUI - Premium feel, iOS-first, better App Store positioning
  2. React Native + TypeScript - Cross-platform ready, faster development, all agents ready
- **Decision**: React Native + TypeScript (confirmed with user)
- **ADR Created**: Creating ADR-001 now
