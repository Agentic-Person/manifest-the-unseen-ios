## Session Objectives

What I planned to accomplish today:
1. Bootstrap the agent orchestration workflow for the project
2. Create ADR-001 to document React Native vs Swift decision
3. Update PRD to resolve tech stack conflict
4. Create Week 1 task files for upcoming work
5. Establish git commit/push workflow

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Agent Orchestration System Activated**
   - First session log created, establishing daily documentation pattern
   - Week 1 task files created with clear objectives and acceptance criteria
   - Workflow operational: morning planning, execution, evening review

2. **Tech Stack Conflict Resolved**
   - Created ADR-001 documenting React Native + TypeScript decision
   - Updated PRD in 4 locations to reflect React Native (was Swift/SwiftUI)
   - All documentation now consistent and aligned

3. **Week 1 Roadmap Established**
   - 6 tasks created with clear dependencies and priorities
   - Day 2-5 execution plan ready
   - Agent assignments determined (Backend Specialist, Frontend Specialist)

4. **Foundation for 28-Week Journey**
   - Orchestration patterns established
   - Task templates in use
   - ADR process validated
   - Ready to begin actual implementation tomorrow

## Blockers Encountered

None yet.

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: React Native + TypeScript (Final)
- **Context**: PRD specified Swift/SwiftUI, but TDD and CLAUDE.md specified React Native. All specialist agent prompts were built for React Native.
- **Options Considered**:
  1. Native Swift/SwiftUI - Premium feel, iOS-first, better App Store positioning
  2. React Native + TypeScript - Cross-platform ready, faster development, all agents ready
- **Decision**: React Native + TypeScript (confirmed with user)
- **ADR Created**: Creating ADR-001 now

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. **Priority 1**: TASK-002 - Supabase Project Setup (Backend Specialist)
2. **Priority 2**: Begin React Native initialization planning
3. **Priority 3**: Review created task files and prepare agent assignments

## Notes / Reflections

**Day 1 complete!** Successfully bootstrapped the agent orchestration workflow. The planning phase proved invaluable - having comprehensive TDD, CLAUDE.md, and master plan documents meant we could hit the ground running.

**Key insight**: Resolving the Swift vs React Native conflict immediately (via ADR-001) prevented weeks of confusion. All specialist agents are React Native-ready, which validated this decision.

**Process note**: User prefers to handle git commits/pushes separately rather than after each micro-task. Adjusted workflow accordingly - focus on execution, git later.

**Looking ahead**: Week 1 Days 2-5 involve actual implementation (Supabase, React Native, dependencies). Week 2 will require MCP servers for design system work, so we'll pause after Week 1 to set those up.

The orchestration system is **operational**. Now we build.
