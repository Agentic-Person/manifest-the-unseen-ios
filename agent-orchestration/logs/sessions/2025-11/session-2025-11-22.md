## Accomplishments

### 1. Screen Mockups Generated (Round 2 - Dark Theme)

All screen mockups approved with dark spiritual theme:

| Screen | Designs | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Wheel of Life | 4 variations | ✅ Approved |
| Phase 1 Dashboard | 4 variations | ✅ Approved |
| SWOT Analysis | 4 variations | ✅ Approved |

### 2. Logo Design - Multiple Iterations

**Round 1**: Initial concepts - rejected (too corporate, too new-age)

**Round 2**: Monk-focused designs - partial approval
- User liked monk concept but wanted more sketch/pencil style
- Chakras needed correct positioning with symbols
- Needed intricate mandala background

**Round 3**: Combined best elements:
- Pencil-sketched monk (from Design A)
- Halo effect (from Design B)
- Hair styling improvements (from Design B)
- Intricate lotus/wheel background (from Design C)
- Chakra-colored wheel integration (from Design D)

## Key Design Decisions

### Color Palette (Dark Theme)
```
Primary Background:  #1a1a2e (deep charcoal)
Elevated Surface:    #252547
Accent Purple:       #4a1a6b
Accent Gold:         #c9a227
Accent Teal:         #1a5f5f
```

### Logo Design Elements
1. **Central Figure**: Pencil-sketched meditating monk in lotus position
2. **Chakras**: Seven chakras with sacred geometry symbols (correctly positioned)
   - Root → Sacral → Solar Plexus → Heart → Throat → Third Eye → Crown
3. **Halo Effect**: Golden glow with floating orbs
4. **Background**: Intricate mandala wheel with chakra-colored segments

### Visual Style
- Ancient Tibetan thangka art inspired
- Hand-drawn pencil sketch quality (NOT flat digital)
- Mystical, sacred, weathered feel
- Organic/spiritual (NOT corporate)

---

## User Feedback Themes

1. **NO bright whites** - everything dark, muted, low contrast
2. **NO corporate aesthetics** - especially for SWOT (organic flower petals, not grid)
3. **Hand-drawn quality** - like whiteboard explainer videos
4. **Cultural fusion** - Tibetan/Hindu/Mayan ancient wisdom
5. **Chakra accuracy** - correct positions and traditional symbols
6. **Wheel of Life integration** - logo wheel reflects Wheel of Life concept
