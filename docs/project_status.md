## Risks & Blockers

### Current Blockers
1. ⏳ **Apple Developer Account** - Application submitted, waiting for approval
   - Impact: Cannot create EAS development builds (needed for whisper.rn, Apple Sign-In)
   - Can Still Test: Expo Go works for UI/navigation/data (no native modules)
   - ETA: Apple typically approves within 24-48 hours
   - Next Step: Once approved, run `eas build --platform ios --profile development`

2. ⏳ **AI Knowledge Base** - Waiting for user to provide transcript files
   - Impact: AI chat feature cannot be fully tested
   - Mitigation: Frontend complete and ready, just needs content
   - ETA: User gathering content

2. ⏳ **Meditation Audio Content** - User generating audio files
   - Impact: Meditation feature only has structure, no playable content
   - Mitigation: All code complete, just needs audio files
   - ETA: User creating content

### Potential Risks
1. **App Store Review** - Subscription implementation must follow Apple guidelines
   - Mitigation: Follow RevenueCat best practices, thorough testing
2. **AI Response Quality** - RAG system may not retrieve relevant context
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, adjust similarity threshold
3. **Performance** - App may be slow on older devices (iPhone X, SE)
   - Mitigation: Profile early, optimize FlatList rendering, lazy load
