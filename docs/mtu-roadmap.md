## Critical Blocker ⚠️

### TypeScript Compilation Errors (44 Files)

**Error Message**:
```
Property 'progress' does not exist on type 'WorkbookProgress'
```

**Impact**:
- ❌ TypeScript compilation fails
- ❌ Cannot build EAS development build
- ❌ Cannot test on iPhone
- ❌ Blocks all forward progress

**Affected Files**:
- All 37 workbook exercise screens (Phase 1-10)
- 7 additional files (phase dashboards, hooks)

**Root Cause**:
Type definition in `mobile/src/types/workbook.ts` missing `progress` property, but 44 files access `exercises[exerciseId].progress`.

**Expected Fix** (15-40 minutes):
```typescript
// mobile/src/types/workbook.ts
export interface ExerciseProgress {
  exerciseId: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  completed: boolean;
  progress?: number; // ADD THIS - 0, 50, or 100
  lastModified: string;
  completedAt?: string;
}
```

**Fix Plan**:
1. Launch 3 parallel Explore agents to investigate:
   - Agent 1: Type definitions (`mobile/src/types/workbook.ts`)
   - Agent 2: Progress calculation logic (`mobile/src/hooks/usePhaseExercises.ts`)
   - Agent 3: Usage patterns in exercise screens
2. Review findings and confirm fix approach
3. Implement fix (add `progress` property to type)
4. Verify with `npx tsc --noEmit`
5. Test in Expo Go browser
6. Commit changes

**Status**: Plan ready, awaiting execution

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk 🔴
1. **TypeScript Errors** (ACTIVE)
   - **Risk**: Incorrect fix could break 44 files
   - **Mitigation**: Use 3 parallel agents to investigate thoroughly before implementing fix
   - **Contingency**: Revert to last working commit if fix fails

2. **App Store Rejection**
   - **Risk**: Apple rejects app (guideline violations, bugs, missing features)
   - **Mitigation**: Follow App Store guidelines, implement Apple Sign-In, test extensively
   - **Contingency**: 1-2 week delay for resubmission

3. **Subscription Revenue Lower Than Expected**
   - **Risk**: <25% trial→paid conversion
   - **Mitigation**: 7-day free trial, clear value proposition, beta testing
   - **Contingency**: Adjust pricing, add features, improve onboarding

### Medium Risk 🟡
1. **Voice Transcription Quality Issues**
   - **Risk**: Whisper accuracy < 90% on device
   - **Mitigation**: Test with various accents/backgrounds, fallback to cloud API
   - **Contingency**: Use OpenAI cloud Whisper API (costs $0.006/min)

2. **Performance Issues on Older iPhones**
   - **Risk**: App slow on iPhone SE/8/X
   - **Mitigation**: Performance profiling, optimization, testing on older devices
   - **Contingency**: Set minimum iOS version to 15+ (iPhone 8+)

3. **Content Moderation for Journal/AI Chat**
   - **Risk**: User-generated content violates policies
   - **Mitigation**: No public sharing, private journal only, AI guardrails
   - **Contingency**: Add content filters if needed

### Low Risk 🟢
1. **Backend Costs Higher Than Expected**
   - **Risk**: Supabase/OpenAI costs spike with usage
   - **Mitigation**: pgvector for local embeddings, on-device Whisper, caching
   - **Contingency**: Increase subscription prices, optimize queries

2. **Competitor Launches Similar App**
   - **Risk**: Market saturation before launch
   - **Mitigation**: Unique AI monk, 202-page workbook, speed to market
   - **Contingency**: Differentiate with features, quality, marketing

## Conclusion

**Project is 55% complete** with a clear path to launch. The **critical blocker** (44 TypeScript errors) has a straightforward fix plan ready to execute. Once resolved, **core features are already built** and just need device testing + polish.

**Realistic Timeline**:
- **MVP**: 2-4 weeks (depending on hours/week)
- **Production**: 5-8 weeks
- **App Store**: 8-12 weeks

**Biggest Risks**:
1. TypeScript fix breaks existing code (low risk - thorough investigation plan)
2. App Store rejection (medium risk - mitigated with guidelines adherence)
3. Revenue lower than expected (medium risk - mitigated with beta testing)

**Next Action**: Fix TypeScript errors (start immediately, 15-40 minutes to complete).

Once blocker is resolved, the project has strong momentum toward launch with all foundational work complete.
